/** Some profiling functions */
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer

/** The object implements a number of named timers and named counters.  Code 
  * can be timed, with the time taken added to that of the named timer.  
  * Similarly, the number of times particular points in the code are reached
  * can be counted, with the count recorded against a named counter. 
  *
  * The normal usages are:
  *
  *  - `Profiler.time("timer-name"){ code }`,
  *    which times `code`, recording the time against timer `timer-name`, and
  *   returns the result of `code`;
  *  - `Profiler.count("counter-name")`, which adds one onto counter 
  *    `counter-name`;
  *  - `Profiler.report` which gives a summary of the profiling.
  *
  * Note that normal scoping rules apply.  In code such as
  * `Profiler.time("answer"){ val x = 6*7 }`, the scope of `x` will  be just
  * the inner statement; normal use would be 
  * `val x = Profiler.time("answer"){ 6*7 }`.
  *
  * For use with concurrent code, it is recommended to start by calling
  * `setWorkers(p)` to set the number of concurrent threads to `p` 
  * (8 by default).  If two threads have the same ID (mod `p`) then they
  * may interfere, both in terms of correctness, and through creating cache
  * contention.
  *
  * As with all profilers, there is a fairly significant overhead.
